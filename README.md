# Getting Started

Read the following documentation in order:

1. BUILD_GUIDE.md
2. CALIBRATION_GUIDE.md
3. SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md
4. KINEMATICS.md

---

# Configuration

Before using the software on your own robot, update:

- Link lengths

# Building Your Own Robot

If you print or redesign the robot:

1. Assemble mechanics
2. Install motors
3. Install sensors
4. Configure dimensions
5. Calibrate robot
6. Verify FK
7. Verify IK
8. Test motion system
